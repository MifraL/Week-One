When I first signed ip for github, I panicked a bit because I skipped the step for choosing the free student pass... Thankfully, I believe it was added to my profile (I checked it!!!). 

I had an issue was with adding an image into the file... then I followed the command in the video exactly as it was and it worked !!!

I learned that when there's instruction follow them through every step and not try to cut corners.
