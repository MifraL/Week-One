- When I first signed ip for github, I panicked a bit because I skipped the step for choosing the free student pass... Thankfully, my account somehow signed up for the free account!!! 

- I had an issue was with adding an image into the file... then I followed the command in the video exactly as it was and it worked !!!

Once again, I learned that when there's instruction follow them through at every single step and not try to cut corners. 

- For the second reading, it was to take notes using two browser.

- When I was using Zotero, I was confused about how to process so I searched up instructions @google.

The following website was really helpful: https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide.

#Helpful websites 

For Zotero, I did find the starter guide to help me a bit because I had a hard time starting out and finding where to go and what to do. 

#Failures I encoutered this week

If there were any failures that I might have encountered, there were minimal to the point that I would not considered them a fail.

- My idea of "digital history."

Prior to this class, I only had a bit of experience in digital history. Last semester, one of my history methods class made us do a project that involved two websites named scalar and VMAO. I believed that to be the defition of digital history. I did not think it would be so broad that it includes non academic institutions such as library, museum, etc. This weeks materials helped me broaded the idea of what digital history could mean. At first, I took the class thinking that I would not need to use it later in my career because I personally do not like working with digital tools. Right now, my view has changed a bit. I do believe it is essential to be familiar with these online tools even if you don't like using them. As technology advances, it is only going to get more convenient to use in our fields. 

- "Digital silences" that I have encoutered.

The thread by Levi was a really good starter to talking about digital silences online. 

I liked her reminder about how digitization is selective. This brings back the point where if youre history, it is highly biased due to external pressure and it is definitely not accurate. Some of my classes that I took, we always talk about how history and past are different. They often get mistaken for the same thing. It should be remembering that history is an interpretation of a person from their own perspective that is subjected to heavy influences. This can be similar to digital history where everything is not as it seems. (2) 

Her third point where the archival description should be read alongside the digitized items is again a great tip. Prior to this class, I took introduction to photography where we talked about how photographs in black and white were mostly considered serious and realistic compared to the color photos when both were as heavily manipulated as each other. They worked well in newspapers because they were described and had context. But then the same picture can be also used for a different newspaper to prove something else. 

A digital silence that I personally encountered would be the lack of sources on the LGBTQ+ community specifically on their architecture in Canada. I did a practicum last fall and I had to do research on the topic. It was hard to find any credible sources that were peer reviewed. 

- Where do I want to go with digital history?

A little bit of backround on online assisgments, I did my first two years of undergrad in civil engineering and I hated the assignments that used online tools. Every I used the computer, there would multiple issues and it would take forever for me to complete my tasks. Although I love history, to this particular class I came with prejudice. I expected to not like the content but based on the first week, I can say the lessons were surprisingly interesting and different, in a good way. I did not expect to like using digital tools but they are actually convenient and I know that I will be using some of them (hypothesis) in my other classes. 

I feel a lot of people don't know what exactly digital history is and I believe it is going to prominenly used in the history field. I feel more inclined to learn about it to help with my interests such as heritage conservation.
