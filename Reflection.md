Readings 

#1 Returning women to the history of digital history by Sharon 

-	The lack of credit to women regarding the origin of digital history = it’s nothing new in history where the prominent perspective takes the center field and the test are ignored and not considered…. 
-	For digital history as a method I never considered it as a separate field till this class… though I am in history and theory of architecture there was no mention of the field. 
-	We only had projects that involved the web for the purpose of giving a wider audience
-	The essay by William Thomas seem to be a really important piece of evidence in regard to the origins of digital history 
-	The development of technology – specially world wide web offered the possibility of expanding historical resources …. He never mentions digital historian women expect anna Knowles a geographer 
-	The next published book by Rosenzweig and Cohen offers the digital work of only Kathryn scalar
-	The author claims that even the most recent reviews tend to suggest that digital history is devoid of women… an example being Julia klein who does feature any women in her article.
-	But according to the article even if you look at faculty that are involved with digital history at least two thirds will be women as seen in Stanford University Digital Humanities department 
-	It is a bummer that not many are talking about these projects being done around the world by women in digital humanities 
-	There has been lot award and fellowships that were won by women in history and them a different perspective that should be looked into
-	Female graduates doing history continues to grow
-	Proof: famous works by well known digital historians 

Why then are they few women in the history of digital history? 

-	Women have always played a role in shaping digital history, but their contributions are overlooked 
-	Well known digital historians do not even mention women in their works regarding the origin 
-	Proof: statistics 
-	Author claims that one reason why women are not recognized is due to “pervasive gender bias in citations”
-	Structure within the academy slowed women’s advancement, a narrow focus on project directors makes us overlook other roles, limiting our attention to digital work done in academy can exclude women in non-academic positions. 
-	This gives the illusion that pioneering work were only done by men
Beyond the senior faculty 
-	Women have a less of a chance of being promoted to high position in history department 
-	Large scale collaboration has a lot of women in it but they fail to be recognized for their contributions 
-	Studied done regarding women in history programs proved that there were more men in graduates and professor roles
-	Women are made vulnerable because of their eagerness to work. This has led to exploitation and exclusion from being part of the main academic stream
-	It only has gotten a bit better (slowly)
-	Discrimination, sexism, in the work field and childcare can disrupt career advancement 
-	Even with these pressures, women still contributed ex Common-Place: The Interactive Journal of Early American Life were published by women not even in high position at the time
-	Although by 2012, 37 % were women in the history faculty, the growth did not help ease the advancement of a women career in the field 
-	It is hard to get federal grant due to not meeting the requirement as most women are not in high paying positions 

Beyond the principal investigator 

-	Most of the time the credit foes to the project director to make it more convenient but this erases any contribution made by women from the field at every stage of the project
-	To hold the role not many people that have the staff positions are eligible 
-	 The most visible digital history project is the valley of the shadow project, but it is attributed to two men only when there were two integral co-editors that were women and they went on to have significant careers in the field of digital history
-	ASHP/CML always had many women in leadership position and they integral to the development of digital history; Andrea Vasquez, Ellen Noonan, Pennee Bender, and the list goes on and on.
-	Theses projects showcase that it is necessary to pay attention to everyone’s contribution in a huge project not just the principal investigator aka project director. 

Beyond the Academy 

-	Include the larder “historical enterprise” to widen the scope of women in digital history
-	Institution that are outside of academy should be recognized for their projects and so that the achievement and contribution that include women can come to light. This field is having more women and they help shape our understanding about history.
-	Need a broader definition of digital history to include non-academic organizations such as library, museum, etc.
-	Libraries and archives pioneered digital work to allow more access to materials
-	Jennifer Locke Jones are important figure in launching an online digital platform for museum… and even won award for the site. There are more like this that were recognized for their online presence.
-	But theses works are hard to identify as individual because it is identified as the institutions. Thus, these women will remain nameless. 

Conclusion 
-	Survey reveals that many women are in the field doing important work
-	To allow for their recognition, it is essential to deconstruct the academy structure 
-	Need to revise the system so that women can advance in the field of history
-	Recognize the work by non-academic institutions

Reading 2: History Can Be Open Source: Democratic Dreams and the Rise of Digital History

- talks about how Wikipedia is a successful work of digital history. Although it is not recognized as a resource for academic purpose, it can be used to lay a foundation for a more accurate information platform. 
- Rosenzweig point of history can be an open source has become true after a decade. Historians have always been critical of Open Educational Resources and the ideology behind it. This article provides a critical evaluation regarding OER in the place of historians by analyzing the foundation and history of the digital history movement. It proposes ways to increase support and broaden the field. 
- “Democratization” gave rise to digital humanities… According to Philip E. Agre an information study scholar technology would allow academics to be democratized and open the existing practices… This concept was proposed by many to transform the way history was accessed and understood. 
- “Democratization” lurks in digital history. It is intertwined with the field. John Dewey states that democracy has to be born anew every generation. 
- disruption does not equal democracy. The article confronts the origin of democracy in digital history by placing it in a historical context… and moving towards a positive definition of democracy that moves beyond the technology and digital aspects. 
- democracy is a hard term to define. As digital historians associate it with structural inequalities, it an be branched into analyzing open access and participation. 
- the internet led to the push in open access and OER into the mainstream. The recent generation finds that not enough, they strive for a much broader term and aim to expand on the structured notions set by academy. There is a transformation in the definition of democracy that has been long defined. 
 
Reading 3: Thread by Levi

I followed the digital archive thread @thomasgpadillahttps://buff.ly/2WvoFjb #digitalarchives

I came across Mayra Corn who put a link to a reflection about the topic of learning to fail @ https://libparlor.com/2020/05/05/learning-to-fail/. 

There was also another one by Chris Hougton in the same thread…. The article recommended talks about the selection criteria that shape digital archives of historical newspapers…. @ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10502-020-09332-1,

I found the way the author went about the topic wonderful. They interviewed people in the field and did a study which later helped them analyze the conversations with the aspect of digitizing historic newspaper and compare it to the current digital newspaper practices. 
-	I found a thread by the LALibraryAssociation about from a collection which shows two guys in a baseball team. I found the picture high quality…. 
-	Amelia Levi tagged a digital archive which is the first database connecting objects, visual arts and literature. How cool is that!!! @ https://sites.udel.edu/thingstor/

This is a nice initiative and I hope to see it grow…

I also visited the #archivalsilences thread 
-	The tag by Thomas Schmid regarding Emily hale letters led me to google search the people involved… and Wikipedia was a helpful source to gain a basis understanding which can be tied to the open review where history is viewed as an open source. @ http://blogs.harvard.edu/houghton/the-love-of-a-ghost-for-a-ghost-t-s-eliot-on-his-letters-to-emily-hale/
